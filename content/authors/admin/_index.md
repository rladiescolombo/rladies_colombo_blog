## Welcome to R-Ladies Colombo!

![Hello World! We are R-Ladies Colombo](helloworld.gif)

R-Ladies Colombo is a local chapter of [R-Ladies Global]( https://www.rladies.org), an organization that promotes diversity in the R community worldwide. We meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools.  There are 197 R-Ladies chapters worldwide and R-Ladies Colombo is the first ever chapter in Sri Lanka.

R-Ladies welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!

As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world. Check out our upcoming events on our [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-colombo/) page. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and projects on our [Github account](https://github.com/rladiescolombo ) and follow us on [twitter](https://twaitter.com/RLadiesColombo) to stay up to date about R-Ladies news! 

To ensure a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates, we follow the  [R-Ladies International Code of Conduct](https://github.com/rladies/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ).
