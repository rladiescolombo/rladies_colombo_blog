First meetup for R-Ladies Colombo is coming and agenda will be out soon. Stay Tune !!

This is the first ever R-Ladies Chapter in Sri Lanka. Anyone with an interest in R is welcome. You can be an R expert or novice. We will promote R, exchange ideas and knowledge and create a friendly network among everyone who use R.

Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesColombo) for updates!

If you have an idea for an event you would like us to organise (eg: R workshops, career panels, networking events, and talks from package developers) or keen to present at an R-Ladies Colombo event, get in contact via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RLadiesColombo) or email us at colombo@rladies.org.
